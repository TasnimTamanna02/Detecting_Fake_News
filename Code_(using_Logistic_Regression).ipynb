The AP is reporting that healthcare premiums are about to rise an average of 25% across the country, even as many American families are already struggling to pay their current premiums. \\nPremiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obama\\u2019s health care law, and many consumers will be down to just one insurer, the administration confirmed Monday. That\\u2019s sure to stoke another \\u201cObamacare\\u201d controversy days before a presidential election. \\nBefore taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. \\nMoreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. \\n\\u201cConsumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period,\\u201d said Larry Levitt, who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. \\nFox News took the time on Monday to hammer House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for her lies that Obamacare would make it easier for most Americans to get healthcare and that it would keep prices more \\u201caffordable.\\u201d \\nPelosi\\u2019s definition of affordable seems to be the exact opposite of what it actually means, because instead of slowing our rising healthcare costs, prices have actually been climbing higher, faster ! \\nAdministration officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law, which are designed to rise alongside premiums, will insulate most customers from sticker shock. They add that consumers who are willing to switch to cheaper plans will still be able to find bargains. \\n\\u201cHeadline rates are generally rising faster than in previous years,\\u201d acknowledged HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis. But he added that for most consumers, \\u201cheadline rates are not what they pay.\\u201d \\nSenator Ben Sasse (R-NE) wants to hear the Obama administration and their Democrat allies apologize for the disastrous plan, because thus far it seems to have hurt the average American far more than its helped. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve reached this point because ObamaCare is built on the lie that Washington\\u2019s bureaucrats are smart enough to plan health care for millions of Americans. At every turn \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s CO-OPs collapsing, premiums skyrocketing, or big insurers bailing \\u2014 the American people have paid the price. More spin won\\u2019t solve this \\u2014 it\\u2019s time for the White House to admit that this law isn\\u2019t working.\\u201d \\nThe people of Arizona woke up to even scarier news on Wednesday when they learned that their premiums would be rising by 116% this year! \\nHowever, in Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark \\u201csecond-lowest cost silver plan\\u201d will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report\\u2026 \\nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called the Affordable Care Act a \\u201cfailure.\\u201d \\n\\u201cArizona families are demanding affordability, accessibility and choice when it comes to their health care \\u2013 not the expensive, restrictive and poor quality care that has been forced upon them by Obamacare,\\u201d McCain said in a statement. \\u201cUntil President Obama and Congressional Democrats wake up to the law\\u2019s failure, and until we repeal and replace it with solutions that encourage competition and put patients back in charge, the Washington-knows-best approach will continue to unfairly burden the Arizona families it was supposed to help.\\u201d \\nMeanwhile, it seems that Hillary Clinton hasn\\u2019t gotten the memo about how bad Obamacare has been or about how much it\\u2019s hurt our economy, because she\\u2019s still out there running victory laps for the abysmal failure. \\\"You know, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare.\\\" #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/TfalVkgAgO \\n\\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 12, 2016 \\nSomebody should probably tell her that the majority of Americans hate Obamacare and would prefer seeing it repealed. \\nIn a summer that saw many insurers drop out of the Affordable Care Act\\u2019s health insurance exchanges, Americans\\u2019 support for the healthcare law continues to be slightly more negative than positive. Now, 44% of Americans support the law, also known as Obamacare, and 51% disapprove of it \\u2014 similar to what Gallup measured last November. \\n51% disapprove of Obamacare (or Hillarycare if you prefer), even worse about 1/3 of Americans say the law has actually HURT them, and long term most Americans think the law will end up either hurting their families or not making any difference at all. \\nHopefully, the Trump campaign is paying attention and will begin hammering away on Obamacare. This is a winning issue for Republicans, and it could be the issue that helps us win in November. \\nArticle reposted with permission from Constitution.com shares\",\n          \"NTEB Ads Privacy Policy Att\\u2019y General Loretta Lynch Pleads The 5th When Asked Questions About Obama\\u2019s Iran Ransom Payment \\u201cEvery Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,\\u201d the source said. \\u201cLike we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression. Evidently Attorney General Lynch and the Department of Justice have decided \\u2018refusal to cooperate\\u2019 is their best strategy. by Geoffrey Grider October 28, 2016 Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by leading members of Congress about the Obama administration\\u2019s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has \\u201cpleaded the Fifth\\u201d Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments \\nSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. \\nIn an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch\\u2019s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran . Loretta Lynch Pleads the Fifth To Protect Obama In Iran $1.7 Billion Hostage Money \\nThe response from the attorney general\\u2019s office is \\u201cunacceptable\\u201d and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to \\u201cessentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world\\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\\u201d Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon . \\nThe inquiry launched by the lawmakers is just one of several concurrent ongoing congressional probes aimed at unearthing a full accounting of the administration\\u2019s secret negotiations with Iran. \\n\\u201cIt is frankly unacceptable that your department refuses to answer straightforward questions from the people\\u2019s elected representatives in Congress about an important national security issue,\\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \\u201cYour staff failed to address any of our questions, and instead provided a copy of public testimony and a lecture about the sensitivity of information associated with this issue.\\u201d Obama on Iran payment: \\u2018We do not pay ransom\\u2019 \\n\\u201cAs the United States\\u2019 chief law enforcement officer, it is outrageous that you would essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries,\\u201d they stated. \\u201cThe actions of your department come at time when Iran continues to hold Americans hostage and unjustly sentence them to prison.\\u201d The lawmakers included a copy of their previous 13 questions and are requesting that Lynch provide answers by Nov. 4. \\nWhen asked about Lynch\\u2019s efforts to avoid answering questions about the cash payment, Pompeo told the Free Beacon that the Obama administration has blocked Congress at every turn as lawmakers attempt to investigate the payments to Iran. \\n\\u201cWho knew that simple questions regarding Attorney General Lynch\\u2019s approval of billions of dollars in payments to Iran could be so controversial that she would refuse to answer them?\\u201d Pompeo said. \\u201cThis has become the Obama administration\\u2019s coping mechanism for anything related to the Islamic Republic of Iran\\u2014hide information, obfuscate details, and deny answers to Congress and the American people.\\u201d Obama Administration Finally Admits $400M To Iran Was Ransom For Hostages \\n\\u201cThey know this isn\\u2019t a sustainable strategy, however, and I trust they will start to take their professional, and moral, obligations seriously,\\u201d the lawmaker added. \\nIn the Oct. 24 letter to Rubio and Pompeo, Assistant Attorney General Kadzik warned the lawmakers against disclosing to the public any information about the cash payment. \\nDetails about the deal are unclassified, but are being kept under lock and key in a secure facility on Capitol Hill, the Free Beacon first disclosed . Lawmakers and staffers who have clearance to view the documents are forced to relinquish their cellular devices and are barred from taking any notes about what they see. \\n\\u201cPlease note that these documents contain sensitive information that is not appropriate for public release,\\u201d Kadzik wrote to the lawmakers. \\u201cDisclosure of this information beyond members of the House and Senate and staff who are able to view them could adversely affect the diplomatic relations of the United States, including with key allies, as well as the State Department\\u2019s ability to defend [legal] claims against the United States [by Iran] that are still being litigated at the Hague Tribunal.\\u201d \\n\\u201cThe public release of any portion of these documents, or the information contained therein, is not authorized by the transmittal of these documents or by this communication,\\u201d Kadzik wrote. Congressional sources have told the Free Beacon that this is another part of the effort to hide details about these secret negotiations with Iran from the American public. \\nOne senior congressional source familiar with both the secret documents and the inquiry into them told the Free Beacon that the details of the negotiations are so damning that the administration\\u2019s best strategy is to ignore lawmakers\\u2019 requests for more information. \\n\\u201cEvery Obama administration official and department involved in the Iran Deal appear to be running for cover,\\u201d the source said. \\u201cLike we feared, the Iran deal is turning out to be a disaster and Iran is emboldened in its aggression.
