In doing so, Obama has been relying on congressional authorizations that President George W. Bush used to justify military action after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Critics have called the White House's use of post-9/11 congressional authorizations a legal stretch, though Obama has previously argued that a new authorization isn't legally necessary.\\n\\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that the administration is dedicated to getting a new authorization with bipartisian support. He declined to comment on specific provisions, including how long the authorization will last, what geographical areas it will cover and whether it will allow for the possibility of ground troops. Earnest said those details were still being worked out.\\n\\n\\\"When it comes to fighting a war, the Congress should not tie the president's hands, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Thursday morning. However, Boehner later added, \\\"It's also incumbent on the president to make the case to the American people on why we need to fight this fight. This is not going to be an easy lift.\\\"\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said talks with the administration are focusing on an authorization time frame of three years, while the other issues are still being worked out. Pelosi added that she ultimately expects a compromise on the outstanding issues to be reached and added that she hopes Congress will repeal the 2002 congressional authorization for the war in Iraq while retaining the 2001 authorization for military action in Afghanistan.\\n\\n\\\"I'm not saying anybody's come to an agreement on it,\\\" Pelosi said. \\\"I think it's going to be a challenge, but we will have it.\\\"\\n\\nThe developments come after Islamic militants released a grisly video of the murder of a Jordanian Air Force pilot by burning him alive. Pelosi also said that the U.S. should \\\"move quickly\\\" to steer military aid to Jordan, which has begun a stepped-up campaign against the militants, including a series of air strikes in Syria.\\n\\nRepublicans generally want a broader authorization of military action against the militants, who have overrun wide swaths of Iraq and Syria, than Democrats have been willing to consider. Obama has said he does not intend to have U.S. \\\"boots on the ground\\\" in combat roles, while many Republicans believe that option ought to be available to the military.\\n\\nSecretary of State John Kerry has testified that any new authorization should not limit U.S. military action to just Iraq and Syria or prevent the president from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary. Kerry also said that if the new authorization has a time limit, there should be a provision for it to be renewed.\\n\\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking member of the House intelligence panel, has already introduced legislation rather than wait for Obama's version. His bill would authorize the use of force against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for three years, but prohibit the use of ground forces in a combat mission in either nation. He has said if the president later decided to deploy ground troops, he could return to Congress to ask for new authority.\\n\\n\\\"It is my hope that the administration will be willing to accept important limits in a new authorization as well as the sunset or repeal of the old [authorizations], as this will be necessary to ensure strong bipartisan support and meet the goals the president set last summer of refining and repealing the prior authorizations,\\\" Schiff said in a statement Thursday, using the acronym for authorization for use of military force.\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Nicholas Kalman, and the Associated Press contributed to this report.\",\n          \"NEW YORK\\u00a0 \\u2014 Donald Trump fired his hard-charging campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Monday in a dramatic shake-up designed to calm panicked Republican leaders and reverse one of the most tumultuous stretches of Trump's unconventional White House bid.\\n\\nLewandowski, in some ways as brash and unconventional as the candidate himself, had been by Trump's side since the beginning of his unlikely rise to presumptiveGOP nominee. But he clashed with longtime operatives brought in to make the seat-of-the-pants campaign more professional.\\n\\nThe former conservative activist played a central role in daily operations, fundraising, and Trump's search for a running mate, but Lewandowski's aggressive approach also fueled near-constant campaign infighting that complicated Trump's shift toward the general election.\\n\\nReached by the AP on Monday, Lewandowski deflected criticism of his approach, pointing instead to campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\\n\\n\\\"Paul Manafort has been in operational control of the campaign since April 7. That's a fact,\\\" Lewandowski said, declining to elaborate on his dismissal. Asked by CNN why he was fired, he said: \\\"I don't know the answer to that.\\\"\\n\\nLewandowski also says his relationships with Trump's top adviser, Paul Manafort, and the candidate's daughter, Ivanka are good.\\n\\nLewandowski was fired Monday after a tumultuous period for the campaign, marked by infighting and rumors. Spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement earlier in the day that she wishes Lewandowski the best.\\n\\nHe is the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party's delegation to the GOP national convention.\\n\\nTrump spokeswoman Hope Hicks described Lewandowski's departure as a \\\"parting of ways.\\\" A person close to Trump said Lewandowski was forced out largely because of his poor relationship with the Republican National Committee and GOP officials. That person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations.\\n\\nThe move came as Trump faced continued deep resistance from many quarters of his party concerned by his contentious statements and his reluctance to engage in traditional fundraising. Trump was upset that so many Republicans \\u2014 House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell among them \\u2014 were reluctant to support him, the person said, and at least partially blamed Lewandowski.\\n\\nPeople close to Trump, including adult children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr., also had long-simmering concerns about Lewandowski, who had limited national experience before becoming Trump's campaign chief. Some of Trump's children were among those urging the billionaire businessman to change tactics for the general election.\\n\\n\\\"Firing your campaign manager in June is never a good thing,\\\" said veteran Republican operative Kevin Madden. \\\"The campaign will have to show dramatic changes immediately on everything from fundraising and organizing to candidate performance and discipline in order to demonstrate there's been a course correction. Otherwise it's just cosmetics.\\\"\\n\\nLewandowski has long been a controversial figure in Trump's campaign, but benefited from his proximity to the presumptive Republican nominee. Often mistaken for a member of the candidate's security team, he traveled with Trump on his private plane to nearly every campaign stop, giving him more direct access to the businessman than nearly any other campaign staffer.\\n\\nHe was a chief promoter of the idea that the best campaign strategy was to \\\"Let Trump be Trump.\\\" Lewandowski frequently dismissed the notion that Trump needed to hire more experienced political hands, spend on polling and sophisticated data operations, and moderate his rhetoric as he moved toward the general election. That approach clashed with seasoned operatives hired in recent months.\\n\\nMinutes after news of Lewandowski's departure was announced, Trump aide Michael Caputo tweeted, \\\"Ding dong the witch is dead!\\\" and included a link to the song from the film, \\\"The Wizard of Oz.\\\"\\n\\nLewandowski was charged with misdemeanor battery in the spring for an altercation involving a female reporter during a rally. The charges were later dropped. Trump defended Lewandowski throughout the episode and repeatedly framed his own actions as a sign of loyalty and a demonstration that he would not give in to outside pressure.\\n\\n\\\"Folks, look, I'm a loyal person,\\\" Trump told voters at the time.\\n\\n\\\"It's so important,\\\" he said of loyalty in a subsequent interview. \\\"And it's one of the traits that I most respect in people. You don't see it enough.\\\"\\n\\nLewandowski's consulting firm, Green Monster, was paid more than $360,000 by the Trump campaign through the end of April, and reimbursed an additional $15,000 for travel expenses, according to fundraising reports.\\n\\nYet his approach within the campaign sparked intense criticism from experienced Republican operatives inside and outside of the campaign.\\n\\nThe move comes a day before Trump is to attend a major New York City fundraiser, organized by longtime GOP financier Woody Johnson, the NFL Jets owner. Trump will spend part of Tuesday and Wednesday at finance events in his home city.\\n\\nMany of the top Republican fundraisers had encountered turbulence between worried donors and a campaign manager who did not seem fully onboard with the idea that Trump and the party needed to buckle down and raise the money needed to build a robust general election operation.\\n\\nRepublican strategist Ryan Williams, a frequent Trump critic, said Lewandowski's dismissal \\\"is the first major public admission from Donald Trump that his campaign is not going well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This shows donors, activists and party officials that he is willing to make significant changes, even if it means parting ways with a trusted political aide,\\\" Williams said. \\\"Now Trump needs to demonstrate that he is willing to change his own approach by toning down his rhetoric and becoming a more disciplined general election candidate.\\\"\",\n          \"Over the course of just a few days last week, Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) went from relatively anonymous freshman senator to what seemed like the tip of every tongue in Washington -- \\u00a0thanks to the letter he wrote and got 46 fellow Republicans to join, warning the ruling Iranian regime to be wary of negotiating a nuclear deal with President Obama.\\n\\nBut here's a fun fact: Cotton made his big splash before even giving his first speech on the Senate floor.\\n\\nThat occasion came late Monday, when Cotton delivered his \\\"maiden speech,\\\" which is typically given after a period of silence and as a statement of principles or objectives rather than a comment on the partisan issue of the day.\\n\\nCotton's address has gotten a lot less attention than his Iran letter, and that is not surprising: Where the letter was terse and seemingly calculated to influence the multiparty nuclear negotiations now underway, the half-hour speech was dense, rich in historical references, and calibrated to further establish Cotton as the Republican Party's young leading light on foreign affairs and defense -- positioning him to assume the mantle now worn by elders like John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\\n\\n\\\"An alarm should be sounding in our ears,\\\" Cotton said. \\\"Our enemies, sensing weakness and hence opportunity, have become steadily more aggressive. Our allies, uncertain of our commitment and capability, have begun to conclude that they must look out for themselves, even where it is unhelpful to stability and order. Our military, suffering from years of neglect, has seen its relative strength decline to historic levels.\\\"\\n\\nThe speech contained numerous references to Winston Churchill and Cotton compared the current foreign policy moment to the prelude to World War II. He articulated a litany of national security threats, ranging from Iran to North Korea to Russia, but the speech was notable for the hard line it took on a question now threatening to divide Capitol Hill Republicans as they try to write a 2017 budget: Is it more important to control federal spending or strengthen the national defense?\\n\\nCotton was clear: America must have \\\"such hegemonic strength that no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the United States. 'Good enough' is not and will never be good enough.\\\" \\u00a0That strength, he said, should come at whatever the necessary costs. While the budget must be slashed, it should not be balanced on the backs of the military.\\n\\n\\u201cOur enemies and allies alike must know that aggressors will pay an unspeakable price for challenging the United States,\\\" Cotton said. \\\"The best way to impose that price is global military dominance.\\u201d\\n\\nAn excerpt from his full speech:\\n\\nTrying to balance the budget through defense cuts is both counterproductive and impossible. First, the threats we face will eventually catch up with us, as they did on Sept. 11, and we will have no choice but to increase our defense budget. When we do, it will cost more to achieve the same end state of readiness and modernization than it would have without the intervening cuts. This was the lesson we learned in the 1980s after the severe cuts to defense in the 1970s. Second, we need a healthy, growing economy to generate the government revenue necessary to fund our military and balance the budget. In our globalized world, our domestic prosperity depends heavily on the world economy, which, of course, requires stability and order. Who provides that stability and order? The U.S. military.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FAKE\",\n          \"REAL\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
